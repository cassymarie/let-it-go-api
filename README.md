# LET-IT-GO!

Let-it-go Api is a Javascript SPA.  This applicaiton was made with the intent to let off a little frustration and put a smile back on your face.  Each user will be able to choose from a selection of different characters and customize their name, knockout phrase and create/edit frustrating sayings/syntax for each.  Once you have customized your character, select them to start throwing items at them!  Choose from items like a bomb, waterballoon, a pie to name a few.  Put that smile back on your face as your watch your nmesis get angry and yell back their sayings at you.  Once you've knocked them out, they will tell you what you've always wanted to hear (knockout phrase) and they will disappear!! Too good to be true!!  

*Note: All characters are setup for fun in mind and should not be used in a hateful way*

## Projects Techincal Requirements

- [X] The application must be an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend with a Rails API backend. All interactions between the client and the server must be handled asynchronously (AJAX) and use JSON as the communication format.

- [X] The JavaScript application must use Object Oriented JavaScript (classes) to encapsulate related data and behavior.

- [X] The domain model served by the Rails backend must include a resource with at least one has-many relationship. For example, if you were building an Instagram clone, you might display a list of photos with associated comments.

- [X] The backend and frontend must collaborate to demonstrate Client-Server Communication. Your application should have at least 3 AJAX calls, covering at least 2 of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). Your client-side JavaScript code must use fetch with the appropriate HTTP verb, and your Rails API should use RESTful conventions.
